since real bodies deform under the influence of forces. But in
many situations the deformations are negligible. In a number
of situations involving bodies such as wheels, tops, steel
beams, molecules and planets on the other hand, we can ignore
that they warp (twist out of shape), bend or vibrate and treat
them as rigid.
6.1.1 What kind of motion can a rigid body have?
Let us try to explore this question by taking some examples
of the motion of rigid bodies. Let us begin with a rectangular

most common way to constrain a rigid body so
that it does not have translational motion is to
fix it along a straight line. The only possible
motion of such a rigid body is rotation. The line
or fixed axis about which the body is rotating is
its axis of rotation. If you look around, you will
come across many examples of rotation about
an axis, a ceiling fan, a potter’s wheel, a giant
wheel in a fair, a merry-go-round and so on (Fig

block sliding down an inclined plane without any
sidewise movement. The block is taken as a rigid
body. Its motion down the plane is such that all
the particles of the body are moving together,
i.e. they have the same velocity at any instant
of time. The rigid body here is in pure
translational motion (Fig. 6.1).
In pure translational motion at any
instant of time, all particles of the body have
the same velocity.
Consider now the rolling motion of a solid
metallic or wooden cylinder down the same
(a)
inclined plane (Fig. 6.2). The rigid body in this
problem, namely the cylinder, shifts from the
top to the bottom of the inclined plane, and thus,
seems to have translational motion. But as Fig.
6.2 shows, all its particles are not moving with
the same velocity at any instant. The body,
therefore, is not in pure translational motion.
Its motion is translational plus ‘something else.’

We shall, in the present chapter, consider
rotational motion about a fixed axis only.
6.2 CENTRE OF MASS
We shall first see what the centre of mass of a
system of particles is and then discuss its
significance. For simplicity we shall start with
a two particle system. We shall take the line

the same body. Note P is an arbitrary point of the
body; O is the centre of mass of the body, which is
defined in the next section. Suffice to say here that
the trajectories of O are the translational trajectories

We shall turn to dynamics in later sections.
We recall that for specifying the angular
displacement of the rotating body we take any
particle like P (Fig.6.29) of the body. Its angular
displacement θ in the plane it moves is the
angular displacement of the whole body; θ is
measured from a fixed direction in the plane of
motion of P, which we take to be the x′-axis,
chosen parallel to the x-axis. Note, as shown,
the axis of rotation is the z – axis and the plane
of the motion of the particle is the x - y plane.
Fig. 6.29 also shows θ , the angular

We also recall that the angular velocity is
the time rate of change of angular displacement,

there is no need to treat angular velocity as a Fig.6.29 Specifying the angular position of a rigid

SUMMARY
1. Ideally, a rigid body is one for which the distances between different particles of the
body do not change, even though there are forces on them.
2. A rigid body fixed at one point or along a line can have only rotational motion. A rigid
body not fixed in some way can have either pure translational motion or a combination
of translational and rotational motions.
3. In rotation about a fixed axis, every particle of the rigid body moves in a circle which
lies in a plane perpendicular to the axis and has its centre on the axis. Every Point in
the rotating rigid body has the same angular velocity at any instant of time.
4. In pure translation, every particle of the body moves with the same velocity at any
instant of time.
5. Angular velocity is a vector. Its magnitude is ω = dθ/dt and it is directed along the axis
of rotation. For rotation about a fixed axis, this vector ωωωωω has a fixed direction.
6. The vector or cross product of two vector a and b is a vector written as a×b. The
magnitude of this vector is absinθ and its direction is given by the right handed screw
or the right hand rule.
7. The linear velocity of a particle of a rigid body rotating about a fixed axis is given by
v = ωωωωω × r, where r is the position vector of the particle with respect to an origin along the
fixed axis. The relation applies even to more general rotation of a rigid body with one
point fixed. In that case r is the position vector of the particle with respect to the fixed
point taken as the origin.
8. The centre of mass of a system of n particles is defined as the point whose position
vector is
∑
m r
R = i i
M
9. Velocity of the centre of mass of a system of particles is given by V = P/M, where P is the
linear momentum of the system. The centre of mass moves as if all the mass of the
system is concentrated at this point and all the external forces act at it. If the total
external force on the system is zero, then the total linear momentum of the system is
constant.
10. The angular momentum of a system of n particles about the origin is
L =
∑n
r ×p
i i
i = 1
The torque or moment of force on a system of n particles about the origin is
τ= ∑ r ×F

The force F acting on the ith particle includes the external as well as internal forces.

11. A rigid body is in mechanical equilibrium if
(1) it is in translational equilibrium, i.e., the total external force on it is zero : ∑ F =0,

and
(2) it is in rotational equilibrium, i.e. the total external torque on it is zero :
∑ ττ = ∑ r ×F =0.
i i i
12. The centre of gravity of an extended body is that point where the total gravitational
torque on the body is zero.
13. The moment of intertia of a rigid body about an axis is defined by the formula
I=∑
mr2
i i
where r is the perpendicular distance of the ith point of the body from the axis. The
i

kinetic energy of rotation is K= Iω2 .

POINTS TO PONDER
1. To determine the motion of the centre of mass of a system no knowledge of internal
forces of the system is required. For this purpose we need to know only the external
forces on the body.
2. Separating the motion of a system of particles as the motion of the centre of mass, (i.e.,
the translational motion of the system) and motion about (i.e. relative to) the centre of
mass of the system is a useful technique in dynamics of a system of particles. One
example of this technique is separating the kinetic energy of a system of particles K as
the kinetic energy of the system about its centre of mass K′ and the kinetic energy of the
centre of mass MV2/2,
K = K′ + MV2/2
3. Newton’s Second Law for finite sized bodies (or systems of particles) is based in Newton’s
Second Law and also Newton’s Third Law for particles.
4. To establish that the time rate of change of the total angular momentum of a system of
particles is the total external torque in the system, we need not only Newton’s second
law for particles, but also Newton’s third law with the provision that the forces between
any two particles act along the line joining the particles.
5. The vanishing of the total external force and the vanishing of the total external torque
are independent conditions. We can have one without the other. In a couple, total
external force is zero, but total torque is non-zero.
6. The total torque on a system is independent of the origin if the total external force is
zero.
7. The centre of gravity of a body coincides with its centre of mass only if the gravitational
field does not vary from one part of the body to the other.

8. The angular momentum L and the angular velocity ωωωωω are not necessarily parallel vectors.
However, for the simpler situations discussed in this chapter when rotation is about a
fixed axis which is an axis of symmetry of the rigid body, the relation L = Iωωωωω holds good,
where I is the moment of the inertia of the body about the rotation axis.

6.10 Torques of equal magnitude are applied to a hollow cylinder and a solid sphere, both
having the same mass and radius. The cylinder is free to rotate about its standard
axis of symmetry, and the sphere is free to rotate about an axis passing through its
centre. Which of the two will acquire a greater angular speed after a given time.
6.11 A solid cylinder of mass 20 kg rotates about its axis with angular speed 100 rad s-1.
The radius of the cylinder is 0.25 m. What is the kinetic energy associated with the
rotation of the cylinder? What is the magnitude of angular momentum of the cylinder
about its axis?
6.12 (a) A child stands at the centre of a turntable with his two arms outstretched. The
turntable is set rotating with an angular speed of 40 rev/min. How much is the
angular speed of the child if he folds his hands back and thereby reduces his
moment of inertia to 2/5 times the initial value ? Assume that the turntable
rotates without friction.
(b) Show that the child’s new kinetic energy of rotation is more than the initial
kinetic energy of rotation. How do you account for this increase in kinetic energy?
6.13 A rope of negligible mass is wound round a hollow cylinder of mass 3 kg and radius
40 cm. What is the angular acceleration of the cylinder if the rope is pulled with a
force of 30 N ? What is the linear acceleration of the rope ? Assume that there is no
slipping.
6.14 To maintain a rotor at a uniform angular speed of 200 rad s-1, an engine needs to
transmit a torque of 180 N m. What is the power required by the engine ?
(Note: uniform angular velocity in the absence of friction implies zero torque. In
practice, applied torque is needed to counter frictional torque). Assume that the
engine is 100% efficient.
6.15 From a uniform disk of radius R, a circular hole of radius R/2 is cut out. The centre
of the hole is at R/2 from the centre of the original disc. Locate the centre of gravity
of the resulting flat body.
6.16 A metre stick is balanced on a knife edge at its centre. When two coins, each of mass
5 g are put one on top of the other at the 12.0 cm mark, the stick is found to be
balanced at 45.0 cm. What is the mass of the metre stick?
6.17 The oxygen molecule has a mass of 5.30 × 10-26 kg and a moment of inertia of
1.94 ×10-46 kg m2 about an axis through its centre perpendicular to the lines joining
the two atoms. Suppose the mean speed of such a molecule in a gas is 500 m/s and
that its kinetic energy of rotation is two thirds of its kinetic energy of translation.
Find the average angular velocity of the molecule.
